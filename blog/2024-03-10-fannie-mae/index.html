        <h3>Background</h3>
        <p>
          Since 2013, following the "Big Short," Fannie Mae has been issuing mortgage-backed bonds as part of its
          "Connecticut Avenue Securities" (CAS) program. This typically occurs several times a year in the form of so-called "deals."
          For each deal, Fannie Mae selects a pool of qualified mortgage loans and issues bonds that enable investors to receive a portion
          of the interest payments from the mortgages in that pool. In return, investors are exposed to the risks associated with those mortgages.
        </p>
        <p>
          For each deal, Fannie Mae publishes data about the mortgage pool. The data comes in the form of a
          <a href="https://www.fanniemae.com/newsroom/fannie-mae-news/connecticut-avenue-securities-2023-r08-deal">press release like this one</a>
          and as a dataset that can be downloaded for free from
          <a href="https://capitalmarkets.fanniemae.com/tools-applications/data-dynamics/data-dynamics-single-family-crt-data">this website</a>.
          The full directory of all deals is available <a href=""https://capitalmarkets.fanniemae.com/credit-risk-transfer/single-family-credit-risk-transfer/connecticut-avenue-securities/connecticut-avenue-securities-transactions">here</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Every month, the datasets are updated with payment information for each mortgage.
          Each row in the dataset is a record of the scheduled payment for a specific mortgage.
          Here is a <a href="./p/CAS_2019-R04_G2_122023.txt">sample fragment</a> of a dataset for the
          <a href="https://www.fanniemae.com/newsroom/fannie-mae-news/fannie-mae-prices-1-billion-connecticut-avenue-securities-cas-remic-deal">2019 R04 G2</a>
          deal, downloaded in January 2024,
          with payment information updated on December 20th, 2023, and the scheduled payment date is October 20th, 2023
          (the latest reported payment as of December 20, 2023 - there is a time lag in reporting).
        </p>
        <p>
          Fannie Mae's Data Dynamics application provides
          <a href="https://datadynamics.fanniemae.com/data-dynamics/#/report/15/CAS">monthly updates on CAS deal performance</a>.
          But what if an investor wants to take a closer look at underlying mortgage performance?

          Capillaries provides an integration test called
          <a href="https://github.com/capillariesio/capillaries/tree/main/test/code/fannie_mae">fannie_mae</a> that processes
          Fannie Mae datasets for 2022 (24,071,388 payment records) and 2023 (5,102,932 payment records) deals,
          focusing on payment accuracy for mortgages sold by different sellers. Data processing diagrams:

        <h3>Numbers and charts</h3>
        <p>
          The following tables and charts tell the story of the AWS-based test environment running the
          <a href="https://github.com/capillariesio/capillaries/blob/main/test/data/cfg/fannie_mae_quicktest/script.json">fannie_mae script</a>
          against the 2022-2023 datasets mentioned above, presented as 287 Parquet files, totaling 459MB, with approximately 25 million payment records.
        </p>
        <p>The charts show Prometheus statistics for the AWS environments. The top graph displays CPU usage,
          the middle one shows Cassandra writes, and the bottom one illustrates Cassandra reads.

        <p>Just for the sake of the demo, let's show someting that Fannie Mae reports will not tell you - the percentage of missing payments per deal per seller. A simple Excel pivot table using data from deal_seller_summaries.parquet shows this:</p>

        <p>Is it possible to tell that some sellers tend to sell mortgages to less responsible borrowers?
          From this dataset - hardly, but running this calculation for older mortgages may reveal something.
          Just a reminder: this test dataset was downloaded from the Fannie Mae website in January 2024.
          The monthly reporting period range for mortgages in these 2022-2023 deals is November 2021 to October 2023.
          This means the longest payment sequence on hand is only 24 months.
        </p>
        <p>
          Can we tell a difference between G1 and G2 deals? We probably can:
          G2 mortgages tend to have a slightly higher rate of missing payments.
